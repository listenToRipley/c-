# Basics of C ++ 

I recommend that you review [Zenva class](../../ZenvaC%2B%2B/README.md) first before going over these notes.

## Booleans

Booleans will default as false, 0 if no value is provided.

## Constance

There values that will should not change ever, these are considered constance. You basically want to "lock" these values from ever being changed.

You add `const` before the variable type.

## Array 

[Arrays](./arrays.cpp) must all contain the same type.

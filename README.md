### Notes

Please be advised that this repository holds my notes and work from the associated classes linked in the different directories. I did not create this content and did pay for these classes. So I want to ensure you support these creators as they did an excellent job teaching me and should be acknowledged for their handwork and dedication to teaching.

I took these classes on both windows and mac computers. You may see more notes about mac setup on some and windows on others. This reflects on whatever computer I had access to at the time. That being said, I recommend you go to the official websites where the classes are offered to verify that you have the correct setup if you want to learn more about C++ through these content creators.

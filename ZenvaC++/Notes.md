# C++

A statically types language.

## General

- `//` comments

- `#include <>` import a library. Between the <> add your library name.

- `std::cout` & `std::cin` allow for interaction with the library as  output and input relatively.

`<<` provide output text inside quotations marks after that.

`>>` provides the input inside of a variable type that must be defined before being called. See [types](./Notes.md/#types) of how to do so.

Statements must end with `;`

## Variable

Variables are a named instance of a [type](./types/README.md) the holds data.

Variables must be started before referenced, but the can change throughout their life, but not change the [type](./types/README.md) of state they are. This is what makes C++ a statically typed language.

You do not need to assign a value when you provide the variable, but you do have to specify the type.

## String Build in functions

If you provide the string variable name and add a `.` after, you can see some of the additional methods available on those strings.

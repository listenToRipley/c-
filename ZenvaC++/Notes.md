## General

- `//` comments

- `#include <>` import a library. Between the <> add your library name.

- `std::cout` & `std::cin` allow for interaction with the library as  output and input relatively.

`<<` provide output text inside quotations marks after that.

`>>` provides the input inside of a variable type that must be defined before being called.

Statements must end with `;`

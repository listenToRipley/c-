# Logical Use

Often requires the use of [operators](../operators/README.md)

## if

[If statements ](./ifstmt.cpp) are logical validations based on if a specific condition is met. Once met, the code in the body will be run.

If the first condition is not met, you can provide another condition with an else if. 

The default response, you would use just an else without any condition provided as this will cover all other conditions.

## loops

Loops are a way the run over and over again.

### while

[While loops](./while.cpp) will keep running the code while the case it true. 

We must be careful when using so we don't end up in an infinite loop.

There should always be an end.

### for

[For loops](./for.cpp) will run for a set number of times.
